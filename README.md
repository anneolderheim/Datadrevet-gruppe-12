# Student Enrollment and Academic Performance Dataset

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive dataset providing detailed information about students' enrollment in various courses, their personal characteristics, academic performance, and economic indicators. This dataset is a valuable resource for data preprocessing and modeling techniques using Python. 

### Dataset Description

The dataset encompasses a wide range of fields, including:

- **Personal Characteristics**: Details about students' personal attributes, such as marital status, age at enrollment, and application mode, offering insights into the diversity of students and their preferred application methods.

- **Educational Backgrounds**: Information about students' previous qualifications and the qualifications of their parents, which could potentially influence their academic journey.

- **Attendance Preferences**: Data on students' attendance preferences, nationality, and special needs, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the student population.

- **Curricular Units**: Information on the curricular units in the first and second semesters, covering credit details, evaluations, approvals, and grades.

- **Economic Indicators**: Key economic indicators such as the unemployment rate, inflation rate, and GDP, which may offer insights into any correlations between economic conditions and academic outcomes.

- **Target Variable**: The 'Target' column provides a focal point for analysis, indicating a variable of interest that researchers or analysts may seek to predict or understand better.

### Repository Contents

This repository contains the following files and folders:

- **`dataset.csv`**: The dataset file in CSV format containing all the student enrollment and academic performance data.

- **`data_preprocessing.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates Python methods for data preprocessing on the dataset. It includes steps for cleaning, handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering.

- **`data_modeling.ipynb`**: Another Jupyter Notebook that showcases various data modeling techniques using Python. It covers tasks such as exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and model building. You'll find examples of regression, classification, or any other relevant modeling techniques.
